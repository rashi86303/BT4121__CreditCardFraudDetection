**Project Title: Credit Card Fraud Detection using Logistic Regression**

## Overview

This project focuses on utilizing logistic regression for the detection of credit card fraud. With the increasing reliance on electronic transactions, credit card fraud has become a significant concern for financial institutions and individuals. The goal of this project is to develop a model that can effectively identify fraudulent transactions, thereby minimizing financial losses and enhancing security for cardholders.


## Introduction

Credit card fraud is a type of identity theft that involves an unauthorized use of someone else's credit card information for financial gain. Traditional methods of fraud detection often rely on manual review processes, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors. Machine learning techniques offer a more efficient and accurate approach to identifying fraudulent transactions.

In this project, logistic regression, a popular classification algorithm, is employed to classify transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent based on various features such as transaction amount, location, and time.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains a sample of credit card transactions, with features including:

- Time: Time elapsed since the first transaction.
- V1, V2, ..., V28: Anonymized features resulting from a PCA transformation.
- Amount: Transaction amount.
- Class: Binary indicator of whether the transaction is fraudulent (1) or legitimate (0).

The dataset is imbalanced, with a significantly higher number of legitimate transactions compared to fraudulent ones. Addressing this class imbalance is crucial for developing an effective fraud detection model.

## Implementation

The implementation is divided into the following steps:

1. Data Preprocessing: This involves handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and addressing class imbalance through techniques such as oversampling or undersampling.

2. Model Training: Logistic regression is trained on the preprocessed data to learn the underlying patterns of legitimate and fraudulent transactions.

3. Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, techniques like cross-validation and ROC curve analysis are employed to assess its performance.


## Usage

To use the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Run the main script or Jupyter notebook to preprocess the data, train the logistic regression model, and evaluate its performance.
4. Experiment with different hyperparameters and preprocessing techniques to improve the model's performance.
